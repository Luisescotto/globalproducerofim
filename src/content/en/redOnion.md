title: Red Onion
slug: red_onion
description: Reddish-skinned bulb with white-violet rings, offering a sweet flavor and milder aroma than yellow onions. Perfect for salads, pickling, salsas, and raw dishes due to its crisp texture. High in vitamin C, fiber, and antioxidants (like quercetin). Its vibrant color and subtle sweetness make it a favorite in gourmet and traditional cuisines.
